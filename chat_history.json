I've successfully created the Vote screen with the following features:\n\n## What I've implemented:\n\n### 1. **Vote Screen** (`app/(tabs)/vote/index.tsx` and `index.ios.tsx`)\n   - Purple gradient background (#9b7dd4) matching the design from your images\n   - Header with \"Whose today's winner!\" title and subtitle explaining the voting purpose\n   - Two video preview cards with:\n     - Video placeholder areas (9:16 aspect ratio)\n     - User avatars with different colors\n     - Username, time posted, and view count\n     - Eye icon for views\n   - \"VS\" badge between the two videos\n   - Three voting buttons at the bottom:\n     - \"Video 1\" button (blue)\n     - \"Neither\" button (semi-transparent white)\n     - \"Video 2\" button (yellow)\n   - Thumbs up icons on the voting buttons\n   - Bottom message: \"These matchups help us show you better content! \ud83c\udfaf\"\n   - Visual feedback when a vote is selected (opacity change and white border)\n\n### 2. **Updated Navigation**\n   - Added the Vote tab between Home and Profile in both `_layout.tsx` (Android/Web) and `_layout.ios.tsx` (iOS)\n   - Used appropriate icons:\n     - Android: `how-to-vote` material icon\n     - iOS: `hand.thumbsup.fill` SF Symbol\n\n### 3. **Platform-specific implementations**\n   - Separate files for iOS with proper SF Symbols\n   - Proper padding adjustments for iOS status bar\n\nThe Vote screen now appears in your navigation bar between Home and Profile, and users can view two competing videos and vote for their favorite or choose \"Neither\". The design matches the purple theme from your reference images with rounded video cards, user information, and colorful voting buttons."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "5bc7368d126bc8dc4f1d2231400afb885d07cf07", "message": "Feat: Implement Vote screen and update tab navigation", "timestamp": "2025-11-26T13:03:06Z", "files_changed": ["app/(tabs)/vote/index.tsx", "app/(tabs)/_layout.ios.tsx", "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "app/(tabs)/vote/_layout.tsx", "app/(tabs)/vote/index.ios.tsx"], "update_number": 3, "parent_commit_id": "76b0d2d2155042c97f2c1c77031c4b85d10e4ce7"}], "timestamp": "2025-11-26T13:00:50Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Please implement these 2 screens into one to check out who wins the day's challenge and make an interactive winners lounge button"}, {"type": "image", "image": {"filename": "image.png", "content_type": "image/png", "unique_filename": "156c50a8-f24d-4e53-a3e7-f9ce2daec8e2.png", "local_path": "/expo-project/assets/images/156c50a8-f24d-4e53-a3e7-f9ce2daec8e2.png", "file_url": "https://prod-finalquest-user-projects-storage-bucket-aws.s3.amazonaws.com/user-projects/c4df2846-a705-4807-a6c6-26da64c88a96/assets/images/156c50a8-f24d-4e53-a3e7-f9ce2daec8e2.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAVRUVRKQJC5DISQ4Q&Signature=W8KHrITAiZllDbBRS5jBUQiBhSE%3D&Expires=1764249193"}}, {"type": "image", "image": {"filename": "image.png", "content_type": "image/png", "unique_filename": "daa72e1f-60f5-402f-a6b8-a4ed6c4d8234.png", "local_path": "/expo-project/assets/images/daa72e1f-60f5-402f-a6b8-a4ed6c4d8234.png", "file_url": "https://prod-finalquest-user-projects-storage-bucket-aws.s3.amazonaws.com/user-projects/c4df2846-a705-4807-a6c6-26da64c88a96/assets/images/daa72e1f-60f5-402f-a6b8-a4ed6c4d8234.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAVRUVRKQJC5DISQ4Q&Signature=B7uiWUinKqY1mrZl048vyV%2FohIQ%3D&Expires=1764249193"}}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand.
